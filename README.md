## Welcome to our SQL Project !


# Explications :

This project was created by three second year students of computer sciences. As part of our SQL lessons, our final exam is a project which consists in the making of a website linked to a database storing the informations of a random company. 🏗️

The use of our website is quite simple : users create departments, positions and employees thanks to complete forms. It then adds these informations to the linked database which is displayed in few web tabs. ✔️  


# Fonctionalities : 

The website allows the user to do few things on their own.

- Home : 
    - Actknowledge writers and their code's property

- Departments : 
    - List all departments and allows to check on employees

- Add departments : 
    - Create a new department to the DB also linked to both departments and positions

- Add position : 
    - Create a new position to the DB also linked to departments

- Add employees :
    - Create a new employee to the DB also linked to departments

- Search : 
    - Search employees thanks to a search bar
