## Welcome to our SQL Project !


# Explications :

This project was created by three second year students of computer sciences. As part of our SQL lessons, our final exam is a project which consists in the making of a website linked to a database storing the informations of a random company. 🏗️

The goal of our website is quite simple : users create one habit per day in a group with other members and have to check it to fulfill it. It then earns points to the party or removes it if the habit is not checked by the end of the chosen period. ✔️  


# Fonctionalities : 

The website allows the user to do few things on their own.

- Home : 
    - Register
    - Login
    - Modify profile
    - Log out

- Employees :
    - Create a party
    - Invite members to a party
    - Join a party
    - Look out for groups ranking

- Departments : 
    - Create one activity per day
    - Specify its name, periodicity, difficulty, color
    - Check activity's fulfillment
    - Add point to the group
    - Remove point to the group

- Position : 
    - Actknowledge writers and their code's property

- Search : 
    - 

- Error 404 : 
    - Redirect the user if they are lost in their exploration
