## Welcome to our SQL Project !


# Explications :

This project was created by three second year students of computer sciences. As part of our SQL lessons, our final exam is a project which consists in the making of a website linked to a database storing the informations of a random company. 🏗️

The goal of our website is quite simple : users create one habit per day in a group with other members and have to check it to fulfill it. It then earns points to the party or removes it if the habit is not checked by the end of the chosen period. ✔️  


# Fonctionalities : 

The website allows the user to do few things on their own.

- Home : 
    - Actknowledge writers and their code's property

- Employees :
    - Create and add a new employee to the DB also linked to departments

- Departments : 
    - Create and add a new department to the DB also linked to both departments and positions

- Position : 
    - Create and add a new position to the DB also linked to departments

- Search : 
    - Search employees thanks to a search bar
